=head NAME

Jit the perl5 runops loop in proper execution order

=head DESCRIPTION

It does only work yet for simple functions! No subs, no branches.
Only i386 and amd64 yet.

This perl5 jitter is super-simple. The compiled optree is a linked
list in memory in non-execution order, wide-spread jumps.
Additionally the calls are indirect. The jitter properly aligns
the run-time calls in linear linked-list "exec" order, so that
the CPU can prefetch the next (and other) instructions.

The old indirect call far costs about 70 cycles,
the new direct call near costs 3-5 cycles and is cached.

Speed up:

Additional memory costs:
