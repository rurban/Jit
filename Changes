v0.02 2010-08-06 rurban

Found the call bug with rafl's help - "use stepi" 
  - call = e9 (using offsets!), not ff 25 (jmp far).
Fixed call near offsets and PL_op offset without USE_JMP_TABLE.
Fixed initialising PL_op
Small programs do work now

v0.01 2010-08-05 rurban

Non-working version pushed to CPAN being on YAPC::EU. Wanted to show it in a
lightning talk.
