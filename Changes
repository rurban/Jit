v0.03 2010-08-09 rurban

Start with amd64/x86_64
Include seperate CPU threaded/non-threaded c files
Create run-jit.c and run-jit.o with .stabs when DEBUGGING
More work on i386thr.c (not working)


v0.02 2010-08-06 rurban

Found the i386 call bug with rafl's help - "use stepi"
  - call = e9 (using offsets!), not ff 25 (jmp far).
Fixed call near offsets and PL_op offset without USE_JMP_TABLE.
Fixed initialising PL_op
Small i386 (non-threading) programs do work now

v0.01 2010-08-05 rurban

Non-working version pushed to CPAN being on YAPC::EU. Wanted to show it in a
lightning talk.
